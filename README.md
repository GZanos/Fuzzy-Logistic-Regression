A Robust Fuzzy Logistic Regression Framework Against Imbalance and Separation

Link to article:


* We propose a new fuzzy logistic regression framework that addresses the problems of separation and imbalance in logistic regression.
* Existing research on fuzzy logistic regression mainly focuses on possibilistic models, neglecting the issues of separation and imbalance.
* We introduce methods to fuzzify binary variables and classify subjects using a fuzzy threshold.
* Different combinations of fuzzy and crisp predictors, output, and coefficients are explored to determine the best-performing combinations under different conditions of imbalance and separation. These are labelled as follows:
        (i) Case II : utilizes crisp predictors with fuzzy coefficients and output.
        (ii) Case III : utilizes fuzzy predictors and output with crisp coefficients.
        (iii) Case IV : explroes an all-fuzzy approach.
* Three optimization and four performance measures are used to optimize coefficient estimates and evaluate classification accuracy.
* The fuzzy logistic regression framework outperforms traditional crisp machine learning models in various scenarios, effectively addressing separation and imbalance issues.
